# The Dimensional Framework
*The universal framework for AI-native generalist robotics.*

## What is Dimensional?

Dimensional is an open-source framework for building agentive generalist robots. It is designed to be a modular, extensible, and scalable framework for building robots that can learn and improve over time.

## DIMOS x Unitree Go2

We are shipping a first look at the DIMOS x Unitree Go2 integration, allowing for seamless incorporation of off-the-shelf Agents() with Unitree ROS2 Nodes and WebRTC action primitives, including:

- Navigation control primitives (move, reverse, spinLeft, spinRight, etc.)
- WebRTC control primitives (FrontPounce, FrontFlip, FrontJump, etc.)
- Camera feeds (image_raw, compressed_image, etc.)
- IMU data
- State information
- Lidar / PointCloud data ðŸš§
- Any other generic Unitree ROS2 topics

### Features 

- **Agentive AI**
  - Agent() classes with planning, spatial reasoning, and Robot.Skill() tool calling abilities.
  - Integrate with any off-the-shelf model: OpenAIAgent, GeminiAgent ðŸš§, DeepSeekAgent ðŸš§, HuggingfaceAgent ðŸš§, etc.
  - Modular agent architecture for easy extensibility and chaining of Agent output --> Subagents input. 
  - Agent spatial / language memory for location grounded reasoning and recall. ðŸš§

- **DimOS Infrastructure**
  - Pub/Sub architecture powered by ReactiveX for real-time data streaming between ROS2 and Agents.
  - A reactive data streaming architecture using RxPY to manage real-time video (or other sensor input), outbound commands, and inbound robot state between the DimOS Development interface, Agents, and ROS2.

- **DimOS Development Tools**
  - FastAPI-based web interface
  - Comprehensive testing framework
  - Docker containerization support
  - Terraform infrastructure as code

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dimensional.git
cd dimensional

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate 

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy and configure environment variables
cp default.env .env
```

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- A Unitree Go2 robot accessible on your network
- The robot's IP address
- OpenAI API Key

### Configuration:

Configure your environment variables in `.env`
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=<OPENAI_API_KEY>
ROBOT_IP=<ROBOT_IP>
CONN_TYPE=webrtc
WEBRTC_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0
WEBRTC_SERVER_PORT=9991
DISPLAY=:0

# Optional
DIMOS_MAX_WORKERS=
ROS_OUTPUT_DIR=/app/assets/output/ros
```

### Run via Docker 
```bash
xhost +local:root # If running locally and desire RVIZ GUI
docker compose -f docker/unitree/ros_agents/docker-compose.yml up --build
```
